# 🚀 Data Science & Algorithms Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of my academic projects developed at the **University of Buenos Aires (UBA)**, demonstrating my skills in **Machine Learning**, **Data Analysis**, and **Software Engineering**.

⚠️ **Language Note:** Since these projects were developed for university coursework in Argentina, source code comments, variable names, and original requirement files are in **Spanish**. However, all high-level documentation, results, and this portfolio are presented in **English** for international accessibility.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
* **Java** (Algorithms & Data Structures)
* **Haskell** (Functional Programming)
* **Tools:** Git, Jupyter Notebooks

## 📂 Other Academic Projects

Additional work demonstrating versatility in Computer Science (CS) foundations and Mathematical Modeling.

* **[Social Network Graph](https://github.com/IvanMV01/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Social%20Network%20Graph) (Haskell):**
    * Modeled a social graph (Users, Relationships, Posts) using **pure functional programming**.
    * Implemented **recursive algorithms** for network queries, such as pathfinding between users (`existeSecuenciaDeAmigos`) and complex logic predicates ("loyal follower" logic).
* **[Input-Output Matrix Analysis](https://github.com/IvanMV01/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Input-Output%20Matrix%20Analysis) (Python/Math):**
    * Computational Linear Algebra applied to Economic Modeling (**Leontief**).
    * Implemented core algorithms from scratch: **LU Decomposition**, **Power Method** (Eigenvalues), and **PCA** to simulate economic shocks on real-world data (CEPAL).
